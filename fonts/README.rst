Following this blog post
http://schepers.cc/svg-webfonts,

except free fonts were gotten from the site with the generator tool
https://www.fontsquirrel.com/

The SVG used at the blog post was used as a template; the text is helpful, but not fully explicit.

But the process should work regardless of the font source.

Another very useful resource:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face

Only the .woff (and the stylesheet) files were retained.
