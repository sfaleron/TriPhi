The ``.txt`` files consist of some discussion and a lot of algebraic and trigonometric manipulations, generally consisting of logs of `Mathomatic`_ sessions and/or a script of the commands used.

The ``generalized/`` directory deals with the general case of a triangle cut by a median, and the properties of the two triangles thusly formed. There's a Python script to play with in there!
